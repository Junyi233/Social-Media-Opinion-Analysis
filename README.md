### Project Title:

**Analyzing User Opinions on "SPY X FAMILY" Second Season Using Social Media Data**

### Project Overview:

In this project, social media analysis was conducted on the popular animated series "SPY X FAMILY" using Python skills. The analysis aimed to collect and analyze user feedback expressed on various social media platforms, including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, WeChat, TikTok, and others. The primary objective was to gain insights into the discussions and sentiments surrounding the release of the second season of "SPY X FAMILY."

### Project Steps:

**Keyword Selection:** The keyword "SPY X FAMILY" was selected as the point of interest, directly relating to the animated series under analysis.

**Data Collection:** A substantial dataset of tweets mentioning "SPY X FAMILY" was collected using Python scripts to access the Twitter API. The goal was to gather approximately 10,000 tweets to ensure a representative sample.

**Preliminary Data Analysis:** After collecting the data, preliminary data analysis was conducted to clean and prepare the dataset for further analysis. This step included the removal of duplicates, handling missing values, and structuring the data for analysis.

**Word Cloud Generation:** Word clouds were created for data visualization to gain an initial understanding of the most common topics and keywords associated with "SPY X FAMILY." Word clouds visually represented the frequency of words in the collected tweets.

**Sentiment Analysis:** Sentiment analysis was performed on the collected tweets to evaluate the overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of user opinions regarding the second season of "SPY X FAMILY." Python's natural language processing (NLP) libraries and machine learning techniques were used for sentiment classification.

**Insights and Conclusions:** In the final phase of the project, insights were summarized and described based on the analyses conducted. The sentiment analysis results were interpreted, common themes or concerns expressed by users were identified, and actionable insights were provided.
